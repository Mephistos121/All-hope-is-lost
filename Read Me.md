# <p align=center> All hope is lost 


It has now been centuries since the devastation of all that was good. The city of Selavor stands as the last beacon of
civilization, the only place that retains any semblance of dignity. Her allies decrease in number with each passing year.
To be born in such a time is to be born into an era of unparalleled struggle, depression, and fear.
The moment the last angel ceases its serenade, darkness will have won.


Monstrous creatures of untold hunger attack from the south.  
From the east, a rising ocean threatens to devour all that remains.  
From the western woods, undead hurl themselves at the gates daily.    
And to the north, a howling blizzard looms, threatening to consume everything in its path.  

To suffer a tragic fate is to be one among millions of innocents who have perished in the maw of evil.   
Starvation, violence, gluttonyâ€”all the sins abound.    
Vast armies of unspeakable abominations promise to devastate what little peace remains.  

This is the story of these times: stories without heroes.  
Because in this world, there is nothing but the prayers of those who long for death.
