# <p align=center> All hope is lost
This is the age of the end.

The city of Selavor stands as the last beacon of civilization, the only place that retains any semblance of dignity.     
Her allies decrease in number with each passing year.     
From the depths of the blackwood to the peek of the demon's crown, you will find no friends in this world.     
     
To be born in such a time is to be born into an era of unparalleled struggle, depression, and fear.     
To suffer a tragic fate is to be one among millions of innocents who have perished in the maw of evil.     
The only stories whispered in the dark are tales of what there is, fear, never of what might be.     
The moment the last angel ceases its serenade, silence will reign.     
    
Every attempt to foster hope has been met with the harsh truth of these times.     
A brutal reminder, etched into the soul and the people of this age.     
The very ground we thread upon binds us to this endless despair.     
Cursing us to do things we never wanted.    
     
This is the story of these times: stories withou t heroes.     
Because in this world, there is nothing but the prayers of those who long for death.
